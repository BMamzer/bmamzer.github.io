## Description

Bartlomiej Mamzer is just one guy, making games in his free time.

## History

Zerdian is Bartlomiej’s first officially released game.
It took quite a while to finish it. Mainly because of the fact that, as a starting developer, Bartlomiej had to learn how to use leaderboards, achievements, cloud save, replays and other cool features that he could find.
During the development the approach changed a few times, the final version could be described as a mix between Geometry Wars, Raptor: Call of the Shadows and Diablo.
The most obvious connection (to Geometry Wars) is the main gameplay and special effects - Zerdian is a twin stick shooter with morphing backgrounds.
Ship upgrade system was influenced by a cool old game called Raptor: Call of the Shadows published by Apogee Software in 1994.
As for Diablo - enemy ship generator that allow foes to have random skills was created bearing in mind elite monsters from Blizzard’s hit game. There was an idea to use a similar item generator, but that will have to wait for a future update, as well as multiplayer.

Zerdian is available on Google Play, although there are plans to release it on iOS and Windows Phone.
